**Exercise 2**


Outwit downloaded

http://www.stoa.org/sol-bin/search.pl was visited

I searched for *pie* and opened that page on Outwit hub

The i was intrigued by the the greek translation so I scraped the Headword, Headword translation and Translation
I learned that <br> is used for the break of a sentence and is useful for titles and individual standing sentence you want to capture <div> is useful for capturing paragraphs as some may contain <br> (breaks) in the paragraphs.

I executed and got in three columns:
1.greek in row 1 (Headword) 
2. Translated word in row 2 (Translated Headword) 
3. Translation in Row 3 '

The information saved was the titles that were inputed to into the description row in Outwit hub along with the information with the markers I inputed

When exporting i first download an xml file which I can use if i wanted to put the information onto my website without the need to write the code myself.
It is also possible to have in the excel file the source Url which could be used to link to the source website or have for reference at a later date
