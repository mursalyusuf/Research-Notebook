# Why I am Here

My name is Mursal Yusuf. I am a Carleton University undergraduate student studying Law with a concentration on business law. In a few years I will be **one** among many that is a part of the workforce the ability to stand out is key. A good place to start is to understand the workings of computers, code and technological advancements regardless of what field. As in this day and age all facets related to technology is ever improving, with this comes the need to be on the forefront of technogologies ideas and ideals. Just keeping up with industry standard as it is now will leave us using models and techniques from
years or decades past being obsolete already if not in a few years time, only being up to date
with the now will keep us unable to see where we are headed. This is common in fields such as
Video game development, excluding companies that use propriety engines changes in industry
standards comes every few years which requires programmers to learn new languages every few
years the now is changing and only by looking forwards will we be ready with these inevitable
changes in a time with the [ expoential increase in technological advancements.] [1] In this
age with a rampant increase open source is what will become the nrom in many fiels. Open source allows the ability to readily allow a large group to figure out the the problems of a few. An example, it is not unusual for a Tech company of 500 to provide services to millions of this 500 the amount of programmers working on the actual code is less, this limits the amount of ideas that can be implemented with Open Source it allows the code to be viewed by many people to keep new ideas ever available. Such was what occured at Blizzard and a Video Game called Warcraft III which allowed a game which was a real time strategy game into what we now know as a Multiplayer Online Battle Area or MoBA for short. It was only possible as Blizzard allowed players to be able to use ingame tools to create maps and custon game modes with all the needed add ons necessary, from this door that Blizzard allowed users to create a whole new game; A whole new genre of games which has given to birth to games such ar Defence of the Ancients and League of Legends, League of Legends alone boasts 67 millions users monthly! A feat from a genre of gaming that is less than two decades old. All of this from the humble beginning of having the ability to change the code of a single game.
are the focus and the goal. Changes are the worked on in pieces and added to the whole as
needed and available, custom features are blocks can be added and altered as needed. the with
this kind of modular system it allows the functions of the part to grow and add efficiancy to
the whole. Efficiancy in the whole greatly increases the worth of the parts themselves such
increases of values can increase the bottom line of all facets of business in many industry
from the usual such as software, economics, business
analysis but is becoming more effieicent as in such cases who  used this model such as [*Facebook* and *Google*] [2] two companies amoung many that have used opening sourcing to increase their ability to create technological innovations and advancements at a accelerated rate by compiling thier own advancements into the growth of a whole. 
Being adept in understanding the use and structure of open source models and
technologies will be a necessity in many fields in the future, Knowing this now will allow one having a leg up now and become among the frontrunners in the work force and what the future
hold, thats what brings me to this course. I am young, and inexperienced with the norms in the work force which can be a hinderance but with the direction the world is headed instead of haing ingrained with how industries work now I am able to learn how things will be in the near future. Focusing on developing an adept understanding of a system interdependant on keeping data open will allow one to be ready once this openness becomes ready accepted which is slowly already being accepted in many industries. So to do this I must want to delve into problems I dont understand, this class can show me a path to open sourcing my work to maximize the return on future projects
by increasing my team mulitfold with the use of the internet and those who excel in a world in
a just delving into. I am lucky I was born at the turn of the century and the beginning of the
tecnoglogical renaissance in a time where data is a treasure troves which with the right tools
are able to be turned in to opportunities to improve the way we view the pas and present. Tracking and analyzing relevant and detailed
data, being able to obtain that information is key. This is a something I must learn this is where I want to grow and the reason I partook in
this course. Doing this will make my experience online more forfilling. Having an online presence for me
has been something that came natural for me, creating an account is something i was accustomed to growing for playing online games to makin an email, i never knew in the future it may be another way how we could become a part of a growing and necessary community. To me the Internet has been a part of my life as long as I can
remember from having an old dial up in my house growing up surfing the web as a kid looking
for games to being a bit older spending time on Msn messenger with friends, editting my
Myspace page to make it more attractive to those who visited the internet has been large part
of my life. For may years this was the extent to my internet use, like a child playing along the shore never realizing how deep the sea really was and the wonders it contained. The internet was this, I used it often yet I did not understand much about, as much as i did about the work behind as I did
from the video games I played growing up, that changed the day my friend
showed me a phising site he had made from code he found on some forum. That is when I learned two things:
1. **That information has value**
2. The future of our lifes would be dictacted by those who had this information

It was as if someone
pulled the veil from my face it showed me what was possible if you
understood what you were doing. On that day I learned that many before me saw, a tool which with you could do anything. Yet a tool is only as good with what you can can do with it. A swiss knife with infinite possibilities only stopped by what you know and what you have available.
