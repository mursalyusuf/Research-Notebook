Working on trying to add coloured text box to text to go along with the video, I've figured out how to add a header, that was the easy part, now I'm just trying to spruce it up a bit 

UPDATE: I have figure out how to centre video but I'm having trouble with adding a coloured text box, I didn't know html would be this hard

Update 2: I like the fact the video is entered but I feel it is lacking something, I may end up adding text below the video to explain it in context

Update 3: Added Header with a Black box around it 

Update 4: Added side banisters, learned that code position effects the visuals 

Update 5: removed unnecessary repetative code
