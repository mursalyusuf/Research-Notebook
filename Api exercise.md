Started by installing wget, following the instructions
inputed brew edit wget and it opened it in vi, i wanted to change the default editor to sublime for terminal which led me to finding code online to do this but ended up messing with the bathing for bash that caused me to lose all terminal commands

it took some research but i find out how to reverse this which took up some time but eventually i switched it and moved on with the assignment

I followed the steps to get the results but forgot to put in #! /bin/bash which caused me to have m permission denied to create results.txt I talked to a few people that also pointed out i was still at the highest level on my computer which may be the reason but to no avail.

I downlaod the Api files in the end 

Tried sed 's/identifier/\n&/2g' output.txt | split -d -l1 --aditional-suffix=.txt - splitfile and received an error stating  more than one number or 'g' in substitute flags
